# Secret Inventory Management

A privacy-focused warehouse management system built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling confidential inventory operations while maintaining complete data privacy.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Contract
This project leverages cutting-edge FHE technology to perform computations on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information. All inventory operations, stock levels, and financial data remain encrypted throughout the entire process, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

### Confidential Inventory Management
Our privacy warehouse system revolutionizes traditional inventory management by:
- **Encrypted Stock Tracking**: All inventory quantities remain encrypted while still allowing mathematical operations
- **Private Order Processing**: Order details and fulfillment status are processed confidentially
- **Secure Supplier Management**: Supplier information and relationships are protected through encryption
- **Confidential Analytics**: Generate insights and reports without exposing sensitive business data

## üè≠ Features

### Inventory Operations
- **Secure Item Management**: Add, update, and track inventory items with complete privacy
- **Encrypted Stock Levels**: Monitor stock quantities without revealing actual numbers to unauthorized parties
- **Private Price Management**: Handle pricing information confidentially
- **Automated Reorder Alerts**: Receive low-stock notifications while keeping thresholds private

### Order Management
- **Confidential Order Processing**: Place and process orders with encrypted details
- **Private Order History**: Track order status and history without exposing sensitive information
- **Secure Order Fulfillment**: Complete orders while maintaining data confidentiality

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Grant different access levels (Manager, Supplier, Viewer) with encrypted authorization
- **Confidential User Management**: Manage user permissions without revealing user identities
- **Secure Authentication**: Blockchain-based authentication ensuring user privacy

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Private Analytics Dashboard**: Generate business insights on encrypted data
- **Confidential Reports**: Create comprehensive reports while maintaining data privacy
- **Encrypted Metrics**: Track performance indicators without exposing raw data
